# Open Source Tools for Data Science â€” IBM

Welcome to a compact exploration of IBM's open-source tools for data science. This repository contains a hands-on notebook that surveys popular IBM open-source projects, shows short demos, and gives pointers so you can try them locally.

ðŸš€ What you'll find here

- A curated notebook: `DataSienceEcosystem.ipynb` â€” a guided tour of IBM open-source tools for model development, fairness, robustness, and deployment.
- Short descriptions and links (where helpful) to notable IBM projects you can explore further.

## Why this repository

IBM maintains a rich set of open-source projects that help with fairness, robustness, model packaging, and production-ready examples. This repo gathers a small, practical selection so you can learn by running examples and inspecting code in the included notebook.

## Notable IBM Open Source Tools (high level)

- AI Fairness 360 (AIF360)
	- A toolkit to help detect and mitigate bias in machine learning models. It contains metrics, datasets, and mitigation algorithms across pre-, in-, and post-processing stages.

- Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART)
	- Tools to evaluate and harden models against adversarial examples and attacks. Useful for security-minded ML workflows.

- Lale
	- A higher-level Python library for automated pipeline generation and safe model composition. It integrates with scikit-learn and AutoML tooling.

- Model Asset eXchange (MAX)
	- A collection of ready-to-deploy model demos (Docker + Flask/REST examples) that show how to package and serve ML models.

- Egeria (metadata and governance)
	- Useful when you want lineage, metadata, and governance across data and ML assets (optional for advanced users).

Note: The notebook contains small runnable examples and pointers; follow the Quickstart section below to get them running locally.

## Quickstart â€” run the notebook

These commands work on Linux/macOS with Bash. They create an isolated environment and start Jupyter Lab/Notebook so you can run `DataSienceEcosystem.ipynb`:

```bash
# create & activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# install minimal tooling
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyterlab notebook

# if you have a requirements.txt, install it
if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then
	pip install -r requirements.txt
fi

# start Jupyter Lab (or use `jupyter notebook` if you prefer)
jupyter lab
```

Open the notebook `DataSienceEcosystem.ipynb` in the browser, run the cells in order, and follow the markdown notes.

## How to explore the notebook

- Start with the introduction cells (setup & environment). They explain which packages are used.
- Try the small demos for fairness (AIF360) and robustness (ART) â€” they are lightweight examples, not full experiments.
- Look for `%%bash` or `!pip install` cells: they help install missing packages when needed.
